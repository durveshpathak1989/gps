# GPS Sensor Library

## Purpose

Reads NMEA sentences from a u-blox NEO-6M style GPS module and exposes fix, position, speed, course, satellite, and UTC data.

## Files

- `GPSSensor.h/.cpp`: UART setup, sentence parsing, checksum validation, and GPS data model.

## Quick Start

```cpp
#include "GPSSensor.h"

GPSSensor gps;

void setup() {
    gps.begin(13, 17, 9600);
}

void loop() {
    gps.update();
    GPSData fix = gps.get();
    if (fix.valid) {
        double lat = fix.latitude;
        double lon = fix.longitude;
    }
}
```

## How It Fits Into The Flight Controller

This library lives under `Submodules/GPS` in the main `Test_Quad` firmware
and is built as an Arduino library by adding `Submodules/` to the Arduino
library search path. The main firmware includes it directly from
`RC_FlightController.ino` or from another support module.

The flight controller runs a 400 Hz control loop on ESP32, so this library
should avoid heap allocation, long blocking calls, and unbounded Serial output
inside flight-critical paths. Debug output should use `DebugConfig.h` macros
where available so `VERBOSE_ON=0` builds can compile prints out.

## Data Type Choices

- `double` latitude/longitude: Coordinates need more decimal precision than most telemetry floats.
- `float` speed/altitude/course: These engineering values do not need double precision and are cheaper to process.
- `uint8_t` satellites/fix quality/time fields: These values are small and map naturally to NMEA fields.
- `char` sentence buffers: NMEA parsing is line-oriented and bounded, avoiding dynamic String churn.

## Usage Guidance

1. Initialize hardware-facing classes once during `setup()`.
2. Keep update/read calls deterministic when used from a FreeRTOS task.
3. Prefer explicit validity flags over sentinel numeric values.
4. Keep units visible in field names, such as `_dps`, `_g`, `_uT`, `_m`, or `_us`.
5. When adding telemetry fields, update both the packet struct and JSON serializer.

## Example Build Integration

```bash
arduino-cli compile \
  --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32:UploadSpeed=921600,CPUFreq=240,FlashFreq=80,FlashMode=qio,FlashSize=4M,PartitionScheme=min_spiffs,DebugLevel=none,PSRAM=disabled,LoopCore=1,EventsCore=1,EraseFlash=none,JTAGAdapter=default,ZigbeeMode=default \
  --libraries ./Submodules \
  .
```

For quiet flight builds:

```bash
arduino-cli compile ... --build-property compiler.cpp.extra_flags=-DVERBOSE_ON=0
```


## Integration Notes

In the main flight-controller sketch, this library is included through Arduino's
library search path. When this folder is converted to a git submodule, keep the
folder name stable under `Submodules/` so includes such as `#include "..."`
continue to resolve.

Most examples below are intentionally small. On the real flight controller,
objects are usually constructed globally, initialized once from `setup()`, and
then called from FreeRTOS tasks at deterministic rates.
